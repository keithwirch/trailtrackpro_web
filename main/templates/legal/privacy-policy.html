    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 28, 2026</p>

    <div class="summary-box">
        LEGAL SUMMARY: TrailTrack Pro is designed with privacy in mind. Your photos, videos, and property data are
        stored locally on your devices and are never uploaded to our servers. We only collect minimal information
        necessary to validate your software license.
    </div>

    <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Wirchbench Networks ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects
        information when you use the TrailTrack Pro desktop application and the TrailTrack Companion mobile app
        (collectively, the "Services").</p>
    <p>By using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION</h2>

    <h3>2.1 License Activation Data</h3>
    <p>When you activate a software license, we collect the following limited information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>LICENSE KEY: The unique identifier used to activate your software.</li>
        <li>MACHINE ID: A non-personally identifiable hashed string derived from your computer's hostname.</li>
        <li>VERSION DATA: The version of TrailTrack Pro installed and your operating system type.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>NOTE: We do NOT collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address during license activation or subsequent validations.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <p>The following data remains strictly private and is never collected or viewed by us:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your media files (photos, videos, thumbnails).</li>
        <li>Property names, addresses, and boundaries.</li>
        <li>Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates for camera locations.</li>
        <li>User analytics or behavioral tracking data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Local Data Storage</h3>
    <p>All application data, including your media library and mapping metadata, is stored exclusively on your local
        device. Transmission of this data only occurs between your own devices over your private local network.</p>

    <h2>3. MOBILE COMPANION APP</h2>
    <p>The TrailTrack Companion mobile app facilitates direct file transfer to your desktop computer via a local WiFi
        connection. Files shared through the mobile app are transferred directly to your computer and are never routed
        through our infrastructure. The app may request GPS permissions solely to mark coordinates for transmission to
        your local desktop database.</p>

    <h2>4. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Map Imagery</h3>
    <p>Satellite mapping services are provided by Esri ArcGIS World Imagery. When maps are displayed, your device makes
        direct requests to Esri's servers. These interactions are subject to Esri's Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Software Updates</h3>
    <p>Version checks and update downloads are facilitated via GitHub. This connectivity is subject to GitHub's Privacy
        Statement.</p>

    <h2>5. DATA USE AND RETENTION</h2>
    <p>Collected license data is used solely for the purpose of valid licensing and support. This data is retained for
        the duration of your license term. You may request deletion of license-associated data by deactivating your
        license key through the software settings.</p>

    <h2>6. SECURITY</h2>
    <p>We employ standard encryption protocols (HTTPS) for all license-related communications. However, since the bulk
        of your data is stored locally, the primary security of your data depends on the security of your own devices
        and networks.</p>

    <h2>7. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
    <p>Our Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
        information from children.</p>

    <h2>8. JURISDICTION</h2>
    <p>Wirchbench Networks operates under the laws of the State of Wisconsin, USA. License data is processed and stored
        within the United States.</p>
